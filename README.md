# scoutbook_parsing
Tools for parsing the output of Scoutbook reports for use in analysis and reporting
All of the tools here are intended to give you faster answers and usable data from Scoutbook reports that you generate for your troop.
Instructions on how to create a report can be found on these threads:
- MeritBadge-data-dump: https://www.reddit.com/r/BSA/comments/15t2s5e/more_advancement_chair_tools_mbs_earned_since/
- Troop-advancement-dump: <coming soon>

MeritBadge-data-dump tools:
- mbs_since.py -- gives you details of which badges were earned by each scout since a date
- mbs_counter.py -- tells you comma-separated: scout, MBs, ER MBs earned since a date
- mbs_between.py -- all the details of badges earned between two dates you enter
- mbs_between_counter.py -- like mbs_counter, gives data comma-separated b/t 2 dates
- mbs_json.py -- scout, [array of all badges] earned after a date
- eagle_review.py -- tells you in 1 second how many and which ER badges are missing: EM of X
  (we refer to Life scouts as being EM3 or EM1 = how many they are missing)

Sample output is shown for each of these tools in the corresponding .output files

More goodies to come -- enjoy!!
